# URGENT FIX - Apply This Update Now!

## What Was Wrong

Your debugger showed the exact problem:
```
outcomes: "["Yes", "No"]"  ← This is a STRING, not an array!
```

The Polymarket API returns these fields as **stringified JSON** (strings that look like arrays) instead of actual arrays:
- `outcomes: "["Yes", "No"]"` instead of `["Yes", "No"]`
- `outcomePrices: "["0.5", "0.5"]"` instead of `[0.5, 0.5]`
- `tags: "["Sports", "Soccer"]"` instead of `["Sports", "Soccer"]`

When the script tried to call `.map()` on these strings, it failed because strings don't work like arrays.

## What I Fixed

✅ Parse `outcomes` from string to array
✅ Parse `outcomePrices` from string to array
✅ Parse `clobTokenIds` from string to array
✅ Parse `tags` from string to array
✅ Added backup parsing in case the first parsing fails
✅ Better error handling with try-catch blocks

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Get the Updated Code
1. Go to the repository and open `PolymarketScraper.gs`
2. Copy **ALL** the code (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)

### Step 2: Update Your Script
1. In your Google Sheet, go to **Extensions** → **Apps Script**
2. Select ALL the code in the editor (Ctrl+A)
3. Paste the new code (Ctrl+V)
4. Click **Save** (💾 icon)

### Step 3: Test It
1. Close the Apps Script tab
2. Go back to your Google Sheet
3. Refresh the page (F5)
4. Click **Polymarket** menu → **Fetch Markets**

## What Should Happen Now

✅ No more debugger pauses at line 200
✅ Data appears in all columns
✅ Prices show as "50.0%, 50.0%" format
✅ Outcomes show as "Yes, No" or team names
✅ Tags display properly

## Expected Output

| Question | Outcomes | Current Prices | Volume | Status |
|----------|----------|----------------|--------|---------|
| Will Bitcoin reach $100k? | Yes, No | 35.5%, 64.5% | $125,430 | Active |
| Copa Libertadores Winner? | Flamengo, River Plate, ... | 15.2%, 18.3%, ... | $50,000 | Active |

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Run the debug function:
1. Click **Polymarket** → **🔍 Debug API Response**
2. Check **View** → **Logs** in Apps Script
3. Look for any error messages
4. Share the log output with me

## Technical Details

The fix adds this logic to parse stringified JSON:

```javascript
// Before (failed):
outcomes: "["Yes", "No"]"
outcomes.map(...) // ❌ Error! Strings don't have .map()

// After (works):
outcomes: "["Yes", "No"]"
outcomes = JSON.parse(outcomes) // → ["Yes", "No"]
outcomes.map(...) // ✅ Success!
```

This is applied to:
- `outcomes` (line 97-105)
- `outcomePrices` (line 87-95)
- `clobTokenIds` (line 107-115)
- `tags` (line 117-125)

Plus backup parsing in `displayMarkets()` function (lines 266-320).

**The script should now work perfectly!** 🎉

If you see data appearing in your sheet, we're done. If not, run the debug function and let me know what you see.
