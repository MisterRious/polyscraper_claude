# Testing the Tag Filtering Fix

## What Was Fixed

The category filtering system now uses a **two-tier approach** to accurately match categories:

1. **Tier 1 (Preferred)**: Queries Polymarket's `/tags` endpoint to get official tag IDs, then uses those IDs for server-side filtering
2. **Tier 2 (Fallback)**: If no tag ID found, fetches all markets and filters client-side with comprehensive diagnostics

This fixes the issues where:
- ‚ùå "Sports" returned "Caitlin Clark stalker" (false positive)
- ‚ùå "Sports" returned "No markets found" (missed actual sports markets)

## How to Test

### Step 1: Update Your Script

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Go to **Extensions** ‚Üí **Apps Script**
3. Select all code (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
4. Paste the updated code from `PolymarketScraper.gs`
5. Click **Save** (üíæ icon)
6. Close Apps Script editor
7. Refresh your Google Sheet (F5)

### Step 2: Test Sports Category

1. In your Google Sheet, click **Polymarket** menu ‚Üí **Structured Format** ‚Üí **Sports**
2. You should see one of these outcomes:

   **Success Case A - Tag ID Found:**
   - Markets load successfully
   - Check **View** ‚Üí **Logs** in Apps Script to see:
     ```
     Fetching category: Sports
     Found exact tag match: sports for "Sports"
     Using tag ID: sports
     Fetched 123 markets with tag ID "sports"
     ```

   **Success Case B - Client-Side Filtering:**
   - Markets load successfully
   - Check logs to see:
     ```
     Fetching category: Sports
     No tag ID found, fetching all markets and filtering client-side
     Category "Sports": Found 45 markets via client-side filtering
     ```

   **Diagnostic Case - No Markets:**
   - Alert shows:
     ```
     No markets found for "Sports".

     API returned 500 markets:
     - 480 have tags
     - 15 have empty tags
     - 5 have no tags field

     Available tags (30):
     Politics, Finance, Crypto, Elections, ...
     ```

### Step 3: Test Other Categories

Try these categories to verify they work:

- **Politics** - Should find political/election markets
- **Crypto** - Should find cryptocurrency markets
- **Finance** - Should find financial markets
- **Elections** - Should find election-related markets

### Step 4: Check Available Tags

1. Click **Polymarket** ‚Üí **Show Available Tags**
2. This creates a new sheet showing all official tags from the `/tags` endpoint
3. Compare these tag names with your menu categories

### Step 5: View All Market Tags

1. Click **Polymarket** ‚Üí **üìã Show All Tags**
2. This shows a popup with all unique tags from the current 500 markets
3. Helps identify what tags are actually being used

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Good Signs

- Markets load when clicking category menu items
- No "Caitlin Clark" or "Dave Portnoy" in Sports results
- Logs show "Found tag match" or "Found X markets via client-side filtering"
- Categories show relevant markets only

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs

- "No markets found" for all categories
- Empty tag lists in diagnostic messages
- Logs show errors about tag parsing

### ‚ùå If Still Not Working

1. **Check logs** (View ‚Üí Logs):
   ```
   Fetching category: Sports
   No tag ID found
   Total markets fetched: 500
   Markets with tags: 0
   Markets with empty tags: 500
   NO TAGS FOUND IN API RESPONSE!
   ```

   This means the API is returning markets without tags. Try:
   - Click "All Markets" to see everything
   - Check if Polymarket API changed their response format
   - Verify API is accessible: https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?limit=1

2. **Run debug functions**:
   - **üîç Debug API Response** - Shows raw API response structure
   - **üîß Test Market Fetch** - Tests basic market fetching
   - **üìã Show All Tags** - Lists all tags from markets

## What the Logs Should Show

### Successful Tag ID Match

```
INFO: Fetching category: Sports
INFO: Found exact tag match: sports-betting for "Sports"
INFO: Using tag ID: sports-betting
INFO: Fetching URL: https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?tag=sports-betting&closed=false&active=true&limit=500
INFO: Received 123 markets

INFO: Successfully formatted 708 rows from 118 valid markets
```

### Client-Side Filtering Fallback

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Broken)

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Click Sports | ‚ùå "Caitlin Clark stalker pleads guilty?" |
| Click Sports | ‚ùå "No markets found for Sports" |
| Click Politics | ‚ùå Random non-political markets |
| Check logs | ‚ùå No useful diagnostic info |

### After (Fixed)

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Click Sports | ‚úÖ Lists actual sports betting markets |
| Click Sports (no tag) | ‚úÖ Shows diagnostic with available tags |
| Click Politics | ‚úÖ Lists political/election markets |
| Check logs | ‚úÖ Shows tag matching process and results |

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: All categories show "No markets found"

**Cause**: Polymarket API might not be returning tags, or using different tag structure

**Fix**:
1. Run "üìã Show All Tags" - do you see any tags?
2. Run "Show Available Tags" - does it create a sheet with tags?
3. If both are empty, the API format may have changed
4. Check API directly: https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/tags

### Issue: Sports shows non-sports markets

**Cause**: Tag matching is too loose (shouldn't happen with new code)

**Fix**:
1. Check logs to see which tag ID was used
2. The new code uses exact/partial matching only
3. No text-based question/description matching
4. Report the issue with log output

### Issue: "Error fetching markets"

**Cause**: API connection problem

**Fix**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify API is up: https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?limit=1
3. Check for firewall blocking
4. Try again in a few minutes

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you confirm it's working:

1. **Try all 12 categories** to verify each one
2. **Compare results** between Structured Format and Original Format
3. **Set up auto-refresh** if desired (see main README.md)
4. **Customize categories** based on available tags
5. **Report any issues** with log output

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Capture logs**: View ‚Üí Logs in Apps Script (copy all)
2. **Run diagnostics**: All three debug menu items
3. **Check API directly**: Visit the API URLs in browser
4. **Share output**: Logs and diagnostic results
